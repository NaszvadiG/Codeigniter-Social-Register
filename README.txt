Codeigniter Social Register / Auth Sub System

This is a sub system for registering/logging in with Facebook/Twitter

It is based on the awesome facebook & twitter libraries by Elliot Haughin - http://www.haughin.com/code/ (@elliothaughin)

DISCLAIMER
----------
This is NOT a plug 'n play sub system. It requires additional work at your end. It's super generic and simple and has some bugs of course.
The fields in the database are just the basics which i thought an app would need

INSTALLATION
------------
1) Merge the contents of the subdirectories into your Codeigniter installation
2) Edit config/facebook.php & config/tweet.php and insert your own App's api keys & signatures
3) Autoload database library (config/autoload.php)
4) Revise controllers/users.php so that it fits your needs
5) Work on the views
